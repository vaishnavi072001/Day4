        height="180" width="180" , align="right" <p><b>Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi</b>; 19 November 1917 - 31 October
    1984 was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as the third prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and
    again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. <br>
    She was India's first and, to date, only female prime minister, and a central figure in Indian politics as the
    leader of the Indian National Congress (INC). She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of
    India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her in office as the country's sixth prime minister.<br>
    Furthermore, Gandhi's cumulative tenure of 15 years and 350 days makes her the second-longest-serving Indian prime
    minister after her father. Henry Kissinger described her as an <mark>"Iron Lady"</mark>, a nickname that became
    associated with her tough personality.<br>

    <h2><u>Early life and career</u></h2>
    <p>
        Indira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru, into a Kashmiri Pandit family on 19 November 1917 in Allahabad.
        Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a leading figure in the Indian movement for independence from British rule,
        and became
        first Prime Minister of the Dominion (and later Republic) of India.<br>
        Indira was her parents' only surviving child (she had a younger brother who died young),and grew up with her
        mother,
        Kamala Nehru, at the Anand Bhavan, <i>a large family estate in Allahabad</i>. In 1930, the Nehru family donated
        the mansion to the Indian National Congress,
        and renamed it <mark>Swaraj Bhavan</mark><br>
        Indira Nehru was taught mostly at home by tutors and attended school intermittently until matriculation in 1934.
        She was a student at the Modern School in Delhi, St. Cecilia's and St. Mary's Convent schools in Allahabad, the
        International School of Geneva, the <mark>Ecole Nouvelle in Bex</mark>, and the Pupils' Own School in Poona and
        Bombay, which is affiliated with the University of Mumbai.

    <h2><u>War with Pakistan</u></h2>
    <p>Gandhi's biggest achievement following the 1971 election came in December 1971 with <b>India's decisive victory
            over Pakistanin the Indo-Pakistani War.</b> That victory occurred in the last two weeks of the Bangladesh
        Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladesh. <br>
        An insurgency in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) formed in early 1971, with Bengali's and East Pakistanis
        revolting against authoritarian rule
        from the central West Pakistan Government. <br>In response, Pakistani security forces launched the infamous
        Operation Searchlight,
        in which Pakistan committed genocide among Bengali Hindus, nationalists and intelligentsia.<br> Gandhi's India
        was initially restrained
        from intervening in the insurgency but quickly started to support Bengali rebels through the provision of
        military supplies. <br>Indian
        forces clashed multiple times with Pakistani forces in the Eastern border. <br>Other clashes also happened on
        the same day but did not receive as much media
        attention as did the battle of Boyra and Garibpur.<br> On 3 December 1971, the Pakistan Air Force launched
        Operation Chengiz Khan, which saw Pakistani aircraft
        attacking Indian airbases and military installations across the Western border in a pre-emptive strike.<br> The
        initial night-time attack by Pakistani
        forces was foiled, failing to inflict any major damage on Indian airbases, allowing Indian aircraft to
        counterattack into West Pakistan.<br> Gandhi quickly declared
        a state of emergency and addressed the nation on radio shortly after midnight, stating: <mark>We must be
            prepared for a long period of hardship and sacrifice.</mark>
    </p>

    <h2><u>Foreign relations</u></h2>
    When Gandhi came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US president.<br> At the time, India was reliant on the US
    for food aid.<br> Gandhi resented the US policy of food aid being
    used as a tool to force India to adopt policies favoured by the US.<br> She also resolutely refused to sign the
    Treaty on the
    <mark>Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)</mark>. <br>Relations with the US were strained badly under
    President Richard Nixon and his
    favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Gandhi politically and personally.<br> In
    1981,
    Gandhi met President Ronald Reagan for the first time at the North-South Summit held to discuss global
    poverty.<br>She had been
    described to him as an 'Ogre', but he found her charming and easy to work with and they formed a close working
    relationship
    during her premiership in the 1980s.

    <h2><u>Views on women</u></h2>
    <p>In 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: <mark>"I am in no sense a feminist, but
            I believe in women being able to do everything.</mark> <br>Given the opportunity to develop,
        capable Indian women have come to the top at once.<br> While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects
        Gandhi's complex feelings
        toward her gender and feminism.<br> Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense
        of natural equality.<br>
        <i>Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the
            difference between
            a boy and a girl until the age of twelve.</i>
    </p>
    Gandhi did not often discuss her gender, but she did involve herself in women's issues before becoming the prime
    minister.<br> Before her election as
    prime minister, she became active in the organisational wing of the Congress party, working in part in the Women's
    Department.<br>
    In 1956, Gandhi had an active role in setting up the Congress Party's Women's Section.<br> Unsurprisingly, a lot of
    her
    involvement stemmed from her father. <br>As an only child, Gandhi naturally stepped into the political light.<br>
    And, as a woman,
    she naturally helped head the Women's section of the Congress Party. She often tried to organise women to involve
    themselves
    in politics.
