    <p>
    Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 - 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and aerospace engineer 
    who was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space.<br>She first flew on <mark>Space Shuttle Columbia</mark> in
    1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator aboard <b>STS-87</b>.<br>Chawla's second flight was 
    in 2003 on STS-107, the final flight of Columbia. <br>She was one of the seven crew members who died in the 
    Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's 
    atmosphere on 1 February 2003.<hr>
    </p>
    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>Kalpana Chawla was born on <mark>17 March 1962</mark> in a Punjabi Hindu family in Karnal, Haryana.<br>
        The youngest of four children, she was born into a conservative society, but Chawla broke several
        traditions to become the first Indian-born female astronaut.<br> She completed her schooling from Tagore
        Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. Growing up, Chawla went to local flying clubs and watched 
        planes with her father.<br> After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical 
        Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982.<br>
        In 1984, she graduated with a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the
        University of Texas at Arlington, and went on to earn a second Master's in 1986 and a PhD
        in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>In 1988, Chawla joined <mark>NASA's Ames Research Center</mark>, where she initially conducted computational 
        fluid dynamics research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts.<br>
        Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers.<br> In 1993, she
        joined Overset Methods, Inc.<br> as <b>vice president and Research Scientist</b> specializing in simulation of
        moving multiple body problems.<br> Chawla held a Certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, 
        gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. 
        After she became a naturalized U.S.<br> citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.
        She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her <i><b>first flight in 1997</b></i>first flight in 1997.

    <h2>First space mission of Kalpana Chawla</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Chawla's first space mission began on 19 November 1997</b>, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the 
        <mark>Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87</mark>.<br> Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space.<br> She spoke the 
        following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space: <mark>"You are just your intelligence.</mark>" <br>
        Chawla had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.<br> On her first mission, 
        Chawla travelled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the Earth, logging more than 376 hours 
        (15 days and 16 hours) in space.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Second space mission and death</h2>
    <p>
        In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107.<br>
        This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July
        2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners.<br> On 16 January 2003, Chawla finally 
        returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated <b>STS-107</b> mission.<br> The crew performed
        nearly 80 experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut 
        health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth on <mark>1 February 2003</mark>, the damage allowed hot atmospheric 
        gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become 
        unstable and break apart over Texas.<br> Chawla died along with the other six crew members. After
        the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the 
        aftermath of the Challenger disaster.<br>Chawla's remains were identified along with those of the rest
        of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at <mark>Zion National Park</mark> in <b>Utah</b> in accordance with her wishes,
    </p>

    <h2>Honours and recognition</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>fourteenth contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft</b> mission delivering supplies to the ISS was named the S.S. 
        Kalpana Chawla after her.<br>
        Asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla</b>, one of seven named after the Columbia's crew<br>
        The <b>lunar crater Chawla</b> is named after Kalpana Chawla.<br>
        On 5 February 2003, the <b>Prime Minister of India</b> at the time, <mark>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</mark>, announced that a 
        meteorological series of satellites, MetSat, was to be renamed <b>"Kalpana 1"</b>.The first satellite of the series,
       <mark>"MetSat-1"</mark>, launched by India on 12 September 2002, was renamed "Kalpana-1".<br>
        74th Street in the "Little India"</b> of Jackson Heights</b>, Queens,</b> New York City</b>, New York, United States,
        has been renamed "Kalpana Chawla Way" in her honor.<br>
        In honor of her, a street was named Kalpana Chawla Street in Rayon Nagar in Sirumugai, a village in 
        <b>Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu</b>, India.<br>
        The Kalpana Chawla Award was instituted by the <i><b>Government of Karnataka</b></i> in 2004 to recognize young women
        scientists.<br>
        <mark>NASA</mark> has dedicated a supercomputer to Chawla.<br>
        One of Florida Institute of Technology's student apartment complexes, Columbia Village Suites, has halls
        named after each of the astronauts, including Chawla.
